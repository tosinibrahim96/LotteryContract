# Lottery Contract
Lottery contract is my first smart contract written with the solidity programming language. It's a simple smart contract
that allows contestants enter the raffle draw by depositing some amount of ether. A draw is initiated and an account is
selected at random. Finally, the total amount of ether contributed by all members is tranfered to the winner.
